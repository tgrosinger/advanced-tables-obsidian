## How to use

To create a table, create a single `|` character, then type the table's first
heading and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>. Continue entering headings and pressing
<kbd>Tab</kbd> until all the headings are created. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to
go to the first row. Continue filling cells as before, and press
<kbd>Enter</kbd> again for each new row.

When a cursor is in a markdown table...

| <kbd>Tab</kbd>                                    | Next Cell                   |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd>                 | Previous Cell               |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd>                                  | Next Row                    |

## How to Install

### From within Obsidian

From Obsidian v0.9.8+, you can activate this plugin within Obsidian by doing the following:

- Open Settings > Community plugin
- Make sure Restricted mode is **off**
- Click Browse next to community plugins
- Search for "Advanced Tables"
- Click Install
- Once installed, close the community plugins window and activate the newly installed plugin

## Obsidian Mobile

When using Obsidian on a mobile device, the Advanced Tables plugin can be used.
Using <kbd>Enter</kbd> and <kbd>Tab</kbd> to navigate the table will not work,
however you can add the "Next Cell" and "Next Row" commands to the mobile
toolbar and use them to navigate, or use the buttons from the sidebar.
